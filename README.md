# Data Formatting, Reporting, and Exchange

This is part of a set of pages on introduction to computer science. https://github.com/cmcntsh/IntroCompSci2021_topics

This week we're going to look at some data formatting and reporting capabilities of Microsoft Excel. Since Excel is widely available and used by many people it is a good idea to get familiar with good practices for using and manipulating data in Excel.

* U of U students have access to Office 365: https://o365cloud.utah.edu/
* There was a nice discussion regarding making business decisions and using data science resources in the Fall 2021 semester. Here are some forward-looking resources mentioned by one of the students. I'm not familiar with all the resources he listed here, but I've definitely heard some of these mentioned by leaders while discussing strategy to be prepared for the future. I thought this was worth keeping note of for future students.

* Data Science Resources
  * I would get familiar with bundled AI packages and integrations that are default on cloud AI platforms from the top three cloud service providers: AWS (Links to an external site.), Azure (Links to an external site.), GCP (Links to an external site.). Hospitals and others in the provider space tend to lean more toward Azure. You should also be familiar with the bundled tools and integrations on AI-configured laptops and appliances.
